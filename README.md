Small library to retrieve tiles from a PMTiles format file. The library attempts to be reasonably efficient and stay compatible with the Java runtimes back to Android 4.1 at the same time.


## Usage

        try {
        }
    
## Including in your project

You can either download the jar from github or add the following to your build.gradle

	...
	    repositories {
	        ...   
	        mavenCentral()
	        ...              
	    }
	...
	
	dependencies {
	    ...
	    compile 'ch.poole. ...'
	    ...
	}
